simple_shell \-Simple UNIX command interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B man_1_simple_shell
[\fB\options\fR]
[\FB\file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read
from the standard input or from a file.
.SH OPTIONS
.B In addition to the single-character shell options documented in the
description of the set builtin command, simple_shell interprets the following
options when it is invoked.
.TP
.B -a
Make something.
.B -b
Make another thing.
.B -c
Make more things.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.B If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c or the -s
option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file
containing simple_shell commands. If simple_shell is invoked in this fashion, $0
is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the
remaining arguments. Simple_shell reads and executes commands from this file,
then exits. Simple_shell's exit status is the exit status of the last command
executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An
attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file
is found, then simple_shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.
